You've been closely observing the targeted residence for some time now. 
Prior to making your move, you've gathered crucial intelligence regarding 
the homeowner and their safe, where the treasure is located. 
<br><br>
The homeowner has a profound affection for triangular shapes, attributing 
to them a significant religious importance. Consequently, should the safe 
feature several lock openings, the triangular one is most likely the correct choice 
for access. Attempting to use the other openings is extremely risky, as it will 
activate the alarm system.
<br><br>
The lock opening is designed as follows:
<br>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/triangle.jpg') }}" alt="Example Image" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    You kept this information at heart, and now you're about to start your journey...
